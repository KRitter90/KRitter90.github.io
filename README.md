    <p>Here I will try to make my first log in form using html coding. </p>

      <h2> Inside the section, I should write a header: h2 </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> learn different tags to get familiar with listing options </li>
        <li> coding an ordered list could be helpful</li>
        <li> be aware that an unordered list also exists </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2> Inside the second section, I should write again a header: h2 </h2>
      <p> Here, I will also add a paragraph. So why am I doing all of this?
        There are so many ways to learn new things for free.
        I think that is super fun. Here I will break the line:
      <br> When breaking a line, no ending tag is needed. It works just like this. 
        So Let's say I want to write even more and make the reader put some extra focus on the next line. What will happen if I add a "hr"?
      <hr> The hr also does not require any ending tag. So what is the difference between "br" and "hr"? 
      So maybe, let's just end this paragraph for now.</p>
      <h4> And how does it look like now, if I write again a header: h4?</h4>

    <p>Where does the aside paragraph end up at?</p>
