    <p>Here I will try to make my first log in form using html coding. </p>
    <section>
      <h2> Section 1 </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> learn different tags to get familiar with listing options </li>
        <li> coding an ordered list could be helpful</li>
        <li> be aware that an unordered list also exists </li>
      </ol>

      <h2> Section 2 </h2>
      <p> Here, I will also add a paragraph. So why am I doing all of this?
        There are so many ways to learn new things for free.
        I think that is super fun. Here I will break the line:
      <br> When breaking a line, no ending tag is needed. It works just like this. 
        So Let's say I want to write even more and make the reader put some extra focus on the next line. What will happen if I add a "hr"?
      <hr> The hr also does not require any ending tag. So what is the difference between "br" and "hr"? 
      So maybe, let's just end this paragraph for now.</p>
        <section>
          <h4> Subsection 2.1 </h4>
            <p> So this is how to write a nice looking subsection. No containers or pictures needed - it actually works with simple text formatting tips. I am very glad that I just found out and can now try more how to use them accurately. I guess less is sometimes more. </p> 
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4> Subsection 2.2 </h4>
            <p> Some more text in the next sub section. I could easily call this a Chapter... </p> 
        </section>

    <section> 
      <h2> Section 3: How to use different tags in html </h2>
      <p> I think here I will quickly use different tags to see how they look like once compiled. </p>
         <section> 
          <h4> Subsection 3.1 : How to use the tag: button </h4>
          <p> Now I will make a button </p>
          <button id="my_first_button" width="5px" height="3px" name="button_no_one" value="click">click me!
          </button>
          <p> Now I will make a second button! <br> Can I also make a button here? 
            <button id="my_second_button" width="6px" height="4px" name="button_no_two" value="click2">click me 2!
            </button></p>
          </section> 
          <section> 
            <h4> Subsection 3.2 : How to use the tag: meter </h4>
            <p> Now I will make a meter </p>
            <meter id="my_first_meter" width="5px" height="3px" name="meter_no_one" value="watch">This is the meter
            </meter>
            <p> Now I will make a second meter with more lines in it! <br> Can I also make a meter here? 
            <meter id="my_second_meter" width="10px" height="6px" name="meter_no_two" value="watch2">Meter 2!
            </meter></p>

    <p>Where does the aside paragraph end up at?</p>
  </aside>
  
  <footer>  <hr> This is my footer. Will it be at the end of the webpage?
    <nav>
      <p> How about I add a navigation part inside my footer? </p>
